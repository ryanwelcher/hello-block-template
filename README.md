# Hello Block Template

This template will scaffold a plugin that is set up for registering a very simple block using the [`@wordpress/create-block`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-create-block/) tool.
Is is intended for demonstration/learning purposes only. There are much better templates available for production code.

## Usage
Run the following in the terminal of your choice:

`npx @wordpress/create-block example-plugin --template @ryanwelcher/hello-block-template`
